AGENCY EXCEPTION: PROPERTY CONDITION DISCLOSURE STATEMENT (PCDS)
Effective March 14, 2023, the Mississippi Code was amended to eliminate all duties and obligations of real estate agents to their clients or others
concerning the Property Condition Disclosure Statement (PCDS) required for residential! real estate transactions involving real estate agents,
including (but not limited to) any responsibility for the completeness and accuracy of information contained in the PCDS, or for its delivery.
IMPORTANT NOTICE: UNREPRESENTED “CUSTOMER”
"Customer" shall mean a person not represented in a real estate transaction. It may be the Buyer, Seller, Landlord or Tenant. A Buyer may decide to
work with a firm that is acting as the agent for a Seller-(a Seller's Agent or Subagent). If a Buyer does not enter into a Buyer Agency Agreement with
the firm that shows him properties, that firm and its agents may show the Buyer properties as a Seller’s Agent or as a Subagent working on the Seller's
behalf. Such a firm represents the Seller (not the Buyer) and must disclose that fact to the Buyer. Regarding the price and terms of an offer, the Seller's
Agent will ask you (the Customer) to decide how much to offer for the property and upon what conditions. They can explain your options to you, but
the final decision is yours, as they cannot give you legal or financial advice. They will attempt to show you property in the price range and category
you desire so that you will have information on which to base your decision. The Seller's Agent will present to the Seller any written offer that you ask
them to present. You should not disclose any information that you do not want the Seller to know (ie. the price you are willing to pay, other terms you
are willing to accept, and your motivation for buying) because the Seller's Agent would be required to tell all such information to the Seller. As a
Customer dealing with a Seller’s Agent, you might desire to obtain the representation of an attorney, another real estate licensee, or both.
